## Description

As a current student, I wanted to create a Read Me Generator that would help a user to create a README file for their app.  The Read Me Generator would walk the user through each necessary part of the file and prompt them to enter in the necessary information.

The user wouldn't need to style or add any code to the README file, simply the information when prompted.  The README file would then be generated with a Table of Contents that when clicked, takes the user to the corresponding section.  Allowing the user to quickly and easily generate their own README file.
